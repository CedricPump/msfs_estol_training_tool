## Purpose of data processing

This dashboard displays flight data collected through the MSFS eSTOL Training Tool. The data is used to visualize and evaluate virtual landings in Microsoft Flight Simulator for training purposes.

## What data is collected

- Flight telemetry (e.g., speed, altitude, sink rate)  
- Landing performance scores  
- A pilot nickname or numerical ID  
- Timestamps of each flight

**No personal information is collected**, such as:

- Real names  
- Email addresses  
- IP addresses  
- Cookies or browser tracking data

The nickname may be chosen by the user or replaced by a random or anonymized ID. The system is designed to avoid any direct identification of individuals.
